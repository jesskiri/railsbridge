This is my first real commit.

## What I learned
* How to create a directory with `mkdir`
* How to change directory with `cd`
* I installed `rbenv` and installed ruby with `rbenv install 2.3.3`
* I installed bundler with `gem install bundler`
* I opened the interactive ruby shell with `irb`
* I closed it with `exit`
* I ran a ruby file with `ruby hello.rb`
* I used `puts` and `gets` and learned about `String#chop`
* I learned to assign a value to a variable
